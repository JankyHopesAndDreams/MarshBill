# MarshBill (Fire Marshall Bill)
MarshBill, Fire Marshall Bill, is an open source retrofit for a "Smart" 3d printing filament dryer that includes fire suppression using CO2 canisters.

### Support
Right now I'm only working with the FIXDRY garbage unit which runs an AC-powered resistive heater on a relay and then a DHT11 for temp data.

### Retrofit Cost
Cost is, if you have none of the parts on hand, 150 bucks more; on top of the 100 for the FIXDRY unit.  I hope some design help will make it significantly cheaper, and the cost being 2 transistors, some pulldown resistors and a single linear solenoid. by 3d printing a canister assembly.
